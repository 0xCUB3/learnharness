/**
 * Delete a session (owner rulings 2026-09-22/23): gates first, then the
 * purge. The owner-locked choreography:
 *
 *   1. GATES — a turn in flight or a running background job refuses with
 *      409 (they write the chat record and steer into it; deleting
 *      mid-flight would corrupt the write-ahead flow). The UI retries once
 *      work drains.
 *   2. EXTRACTION WIND-DOWN — the chat's own pipeline run is TRUE-
 *      CANCELLED (abortExtraction: spend stops, nothing merges), then
 *      awaited off the registry. A timeout is a retryable 503, never a
 *      forced race.
 *   3. THE SYNC BLOCK — everything below runs without a single await:
 *      no extraction append can interleave (the event loop never yields
 *      mid-block), so the read-filter-write of the ledger rewrites is
 *      atomic against the pipeline. Ledgers first, jobs next, the chat
 *      record LAST (a crash mid-block leaves a deletable chat with a
 *      purged graph — re-running DELETE fixes it — never a deleted chat
 *      with live traces). The pipeline's per-batch liveness guard
 *      (extraction.ts) closes the last window: a run that slipped past
 *      the wind-down finds the chat gone at its merge and aborts with
 *      nothing merged.
