/**
 * The agent-split tool composition (docs/probe-teach-split.md §1): the
 * PROBER and the TEACHER are different agents with different tool sets.
 * The question tools share a NAME but are genuinely DIFFERENT tools —
 * the prober's quiz has NO nodeId field at all (its declaration is built
 * from quizInputBase; the model's schema never mentions nodeId), the
 * teacher's carries the validated position field.
 *
 * - Question tools (quiz / ask_user_question): CLIENT-ANSWERED. Their
 *   execute validates the authoring refinements (the cross-field rules no
 *   schema carries — quizInputProblems / askOptionProblems; a failure
 *   throws ToolInputError, which pi's loop converts to an error tool
 *   result the model retries on), then returns the synthetic
 *   "question posed" placeholder (questionResult: terminate: true — the
 *   turn ends; the call streams to the browser in `input-available`
 *   state; the learner answers in the dock; the client grades and sends
 *   the verdict with addToolOutput). Input schemas live in
 *   core/question-core. Question tools opt into SEQUENTIAL execution so
 *   parallel calls resolve in the model's call order (the dock's subject
 *   can never flip mid-turn).
 * - probe_done (src/agent/tools/probe.ts): SERVER-SIDE seam tool.
 * - planTools (src/agent/tools/plan.ts): SERVER-SIDE — author-once
 *   plan_init. Teacher only.
 * - jobTools (src/agent/tools/jobs.ts): SERVER-EXECUTED dispatch. Teacher
 *   only.
