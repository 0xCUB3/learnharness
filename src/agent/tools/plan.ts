/**
 * The plan tool — AUTHOR-ONCE protocol (2026-09-03 design pass): the teacher
 * WRITES the map and never tracks progress. One tool, plan_init, takes the
 * whole dependency map as a mermaid `graph TD` block:
 *
 *   - call it ONCE right after the probe concludes, to present the map (the
 *     LEARNER'S ACCEPTANCE of the presented plan, not this call, ends
 *     planning — docs/probe-teach-split.md §4)
 *   - statuses (current / visited / upcoming) are DERIVED from the quiz
 *     nodeId tags the teacher fires (contracts.ts derivePlanStatuses) — the
 *     teacher never declares them, and there is no "done" bookkeeping
 *   - re-call it any time the map is wrong: the new block replaces the tree
 *     wholesale. Node slugs are permanent — the map tracks nothing between
 *     rewrites
 *   - checks name the node they assess (quiz nodeId, validated against the
 *     live tree at the call boundary) — that tag is the only thing statuses
 *     derive from
 *
 * The former mutation tools (add/update/remove node/edge, set_current,
 * mark_done) are gone by design: restructuring is a rewrite, tracking is
 * derived. SERVER-SIDE with execute: parse → validate → persist → return
 * the FULL canonicalized tree (PlanToolResult), so the tree panel renders the
 * latest state straight from the transcript's tool outputs (the plan
 * window and the plan blocks).
