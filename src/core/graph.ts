/**
 * The knowledge graph: merger (the deterministic final stage of the
 * extraction pipeline — vision §1 construction) + derivation (reads).
 *
 * The extraction pipeline is the SOLE graph writer, tree-blind and post-hoc
 * (2026-09-27 cleanup — clear separation of work):
 *
 *   extractor (LLM)  → SessionFindings: the raw reasoning chains —
 *                      propositions (lonely relevant ones included) and
 *                      follows/supports edges,
 *                      from the source ALONE (whole session as markdown,
 *                      or raw notes). Fully trusted: no stage re-checks it.
 *   auditor (LLM)    → AuditVerdicts: identity links (local id → an existing
 *                      node, or create) via graph-exploration tools —
 *                      links ONLY (owner, 2026-09-28 evening: the auditor
 *                      never mints edges; cross-source connection happens
 *                      solely through identified equivalences). Never sees
 *                      the source; never drops.
 *   merger (HERE)    → mergeFindings(): deterministic ledger appends
 *
 * The merger is deliberately the ONLY stage that touches the ledgers, and it
 * is pure code: the LLM supplies exactly the judgment calls (what the
 * propositions are, what follows/supports what, whether a proposition IS an
 * existing node), while timestamps/provenance — anything the model could
 * silently mis-copy — are rebuilt deterministically. Idempotent +
 * incremental: edges dedupe by (from,to,type)-already-asserted-by-this-chat,
 * mapping lines dedupe by (chat, sourceId), and coverage entries /
 * sessions.jsonl checkpoints which messages and chats have been extracted
 * (never the same turns twice). No events: the events ledger is GONE
 * (2026-09-27) — the graph carries propositions + edges, nothing else.
 *
 * Identity across re-encounters is the AUDITOR's judgment (link-or-create
 * with an equivalence bias — paraphrases merge), not string matching.
 * A re-extracted session's propositions link to the existing nodes; the
 * link appends a node line whose phrasings join `aliases` and whose
 * provenance unions (getGraph merges lines by id).
 *
 * Derivation below (getGraph / graphSnapshot) is reads only — everything
 * is recomputed from the ledgers. Every function takes the storage ports
 * (core/ports.ts) as explicit parameters — pure core, no adapter imports;
 * the composition root (src/server/stores.ts) wires the fs adapters in.
