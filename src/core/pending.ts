/**
 * The pending-question gate: an unanswered QUESTION tool part (quiz/ask)
 * blocks the composer — one question at a time, mirroring the teacher's
 * prompt contract. Derived client state; the server enforces nothing.
 *
 * Scan order: MESSAGES newest-first (a later turn's live question supersedes
 * an older dangling one), but PARTS forward within a message — the model's
 * FIRST unanswered question is the dock subject. Parallel question calls
 * (pi executes them in one batch) are thus answered in the same order they
 * were asked, saved, and rendered as cards; a backward part scan reversed
 * that order (the live modal-realism observation).
 *
 * Job tool parts (research/demo/visual) never pend client-side — the async
 * protocol resolves them server-side with an immediate ack (see
 * contracts/jobs.ts "THE ASYNC PROTOCOL"), so job tools are NOT returned
 * here. This file carries only the question gate and the shared scan helper.
